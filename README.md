This is a full stack project called Menu-Manage where dishes are stored in a MySQL database and displayed on a React dashboard. 

Each dish has a name, an image, and a publish/unpublish toggle button, and clicking the button updates the backend through FastAPI and instantly reflects on the UI.Real-time updates are also implemented using WebSockets, so if the dish status is changed directly in the backend or in the database, the dashboard updates automatically without refreshing. 

Backend uses FastAPI, frontend uses React, and the database is MySQL everything matches the problem statement and works together smoothly. Built half-sleepy, half-focused, in the stress of my capstone project presentation  I literally wasted all this project time there, so if there are any issues in the code please consider it,

thank you
